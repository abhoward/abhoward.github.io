# Shiny Pokemon 

Down here you can see stats for the Safari Week 2023 community event, in which shiny Pokemon hunters hunt Pokemon exclusively in the games' Safari Zones. All data for this event was sourced from [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) and visualized with [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). Furthermore, [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) AI language model Davinci was used to assist in extracting data from tweets (after fine-tuning it across ~250 tweets).
